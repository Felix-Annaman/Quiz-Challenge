This is a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions, built to run in the browser. It features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript.

## User Story

As a user, I want to take a code quiz. When I click the start button, a timer starts and I am presented with a question. When I answer a question, I am presented with another question. When I answer a question incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock. When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over. When the game is over, I can save my initials and score.
